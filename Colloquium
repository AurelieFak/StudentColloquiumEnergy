PAPER STUDENT COLLOQUIUM

Here by energy we focus on electricity power

FINAL GOAL : present the best features in one sentence

ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION
Goal
Problematics

Nowadays energy consumption is a global challenge/major issue

For years many UI have been implemented in order to provide an eco feedback to the users so that they can be aware of their energy usage...
Many studies have shown that the design of those interfaces and their components affect ( in a different way ) the understanding of the data and in consequence/at the end the user behavior.


Our goal is to investigate about the different ways to display to the users their electricity usage
Those different components are most of the time : historical comparison, presentation of costs, incentive, reward, commitment
From those components we want to extract the most effective ones : by effective we mean the ones which are more likely to help users reduce their electricity usage/save energy
Thanks to previous surveys we are going to compare percentage in the reduction of electricty use according to the use of the different components.
We are also going to compare different already existing UI (not sure)
As a criteria for the most effective ones studies have demonstrated that the information provided must be intuitive, clear and simple and the UI attractive and not too intrusive( eg not too many notifications) 
so that the user keeps using it and is integrated in their everyday life

In this paper we'll ( try to ) answer the following questions : What are the main components ? Which can they be presented in an effective way ?


BODY OF THE TEXT

I- (AURELIE) Presentation/listing of the main or key design components :
Feedback
Incentive
Comparison : historical and normative , weather affect
goal setting , user psychology blablabla
Commitment
Disaggregation
rewards
penalization
^explanation of different UI components

The different types of app : classical and games
Smart meter, Personal computer, mobile devices, house display

II-The surveys (WOUTER): who best than the user itself is capable of saying what he needs and what he wants to see ?
Explaining the process 
use of protoypes of UI so that the interviewee/respondent can choose and rate
Interviews to answer the question : What kind of electricity consumption feedback consumers understand and prefer ? => difficiulties with scientiic units blablabla 
Kind of questions asked

III- HOW 
Kind of presentation that the users prefere graphical vs Text => guidelines of Smith and Mosier
GRAPHICAL blablabla
chart pie , bar chart, tabular presentation
Title idea : graphical, numerical and textual presentation



RESULTS/DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION
Percentage for example ; when providing an historical comparison the decrease is about 10-15% BLABLABLA

As a conclusion,most valued components according to the surveys and research 



Key words and sentences 
FEEEEDBACK
Percentage
Charts , graphics
The saving will be more consequent depending on the type and quality of the feedback
